### Backup Storage

Backup storage is a means of storing [[backup objects|Jargon-Dictionary#Backup-Object]]. Backup objects can be stored on a local file system, served through http or using [Indelible FS](http://www.igeekinc.com/indeliblefs/en/indeliblefs.html) (experimental).

### Backup Object

A backup object is basically a hard drive image. Backup objects that hold bootable partitions are called [[machine images|Jargon-Dictionary#Machine-Image]].

### Security Group

Wakame-vdc's dynamically updating firewall. You can put [[vnics|Jargon-Dictionary#Vnic-/-Vif]] into groups that determine which network traffic is blocked and which is accepted.
